Downloading demo package
------------------------

To get the demo, you can either `download`_ the repository from GitHub or checkout
the `source code`_ directly.

Reports are available also online in `generated results`_.

Overview
--------
In this sample framework, you will find test cases for iOS and Android.
Test cases are written for sample applications under `demoapp`_ folder.

- Test suite for iOS and Android Locators
- Test suite for iOS and Android  Mobile Web Testing
- Test suite for iOS and Android  Basic Interactions
- Test suite for iOS and Android  Selectors

Generated results
-----------------
After `running tests`_ you will get report and log in HTML format. Example
files are also visible online in case you are not interested in running
the demo yourself:

- `report.html`_
- `log.html`_

Running Sample
==============
Preconditions
-------------

Install `Robot Framework`_ and `AppiumLibrary`_

The simplest way is using `pip`_ package manager::

  pip install -r requirements.txt


Device Setup
------------
After installing the library, you still need to setup an simulator/emulator or real device to use in tests.
iOS and Android have separate paths to follow, and those steps better explained in `Appium Driver Setup Guide`_.
Please follow the **Driver-Specific Setup** according to platform.


Running tests
-------------

Test cases are located in the ``tests`` folder. They can be
executed using the ``robot`` command::

    robot  tests/*.test.robot

You can also run an iOS or Android case file/test::

    robot tests/android_basic_interactions.test.robot
    robot --test "Should find elements by ID" tests


TODO
----
There are much more to improve, here is the list of things to come

- Circle.ci build pipeline
- SauceLabs Execution Support
- More coverage from library methods
